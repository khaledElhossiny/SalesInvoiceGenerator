# SalesInvoiceGenerator
InvoiceHeaders, InvoiceLines files path -> Sales Invoice Generator\\dist

Exception Handling:
Fixed exception handling by displaying messages to guide the users

Data Storage techniques & I/O Streams:
Data are in the correct format, pls make sure to open the files (follow file path ->Sales Invoice Generator\\dist)  and read the data
ArrayList<InvoiceHeader> readFile() and writeFile(ArrayList<InvoiceHeader>) exist in the FIleOperations Class, pls make sure to check the class methods

GUI and Action handling:
Delete, Save, and Cancel buttons are working (user msgs are now available to guide users)
I just have an issue understanding how the Create method should work

Please help me understande the requirments for the createNewInvoice method
